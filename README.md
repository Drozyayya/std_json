# JSON support for the C++ standard library

## What is this?

This repository documents the work on a [**proposal**](https://github.com/nlohmann/std_json/blob/master/proposal.md) for JSON support in the C++ standard library. It follows a [previous discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/std-proposals/JNZzOvC7llo) in the [std-proposals forum](http://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/std-proposals) on the topic.

## Where is the proposal?

It's [**here**](https://github.com/nlohmann/std_json/blob/master/proposal.md).

## Can I help?

Yes, of course! Have a look at the [proposal](https://github.com/nlohmann/std_json/blob/master/proposal.md) and [open an issue](https://github.com/nlohmann/std_json/issues/new).

## Is it done?

No.

## When is it done?

We have no idea.

## Who are you?

Currently, this is the work of [Niels Lohmann](http://nlohmann.me) and Mario Konrad. We would be happy for any help and feedback we can get.

## How is this related to [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)?

Apparently, [Niels](https://github.com/nlohmann) is involved in both projects. He is working on the library [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for several years now and has been asked on several occasions to write a proposal for the C++ standard library. This proposal surely is inspired by that library, but shall evolve independently from it.
